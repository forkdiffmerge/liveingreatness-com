## Protocol Check

Use Protocol Check when you believe a protocol is being used incorrectly in 
any way or when a Core Commitment is being broken.

### Steps

1. Say “Protocol Check.”
2. If you know the correct use of the protocol, state it. If you don’t, ask for help.

### Commitments

* Say “Protocol Check” as soon as you become aware of the incorrect use of a protocol, or of a broken Core Commitment. Do this regardless of the current activity.
* Be supportive of anyone using Protocol Check.
* Do not shame or punish anyone using Protocol Check.
* Ask for help as soon as you realize you are unsure of the correct protocol use.
